The main objective of this Android project is to provide rich and relevant travel-related information to users on the move.
The idea is to create a smart travel guide app that users can access anytime and from anywhere.
Since the proposed app is based on request and response, it does not require the continual acquisition of bandwidth.

While visiting new places, tourists often have a complaint that they cannot access and obtain travel information timely and on-the-go. 
This smart travel guide app seeks to solve that problem.

Requirements: 
Users are able to read text about the places they can visit in that area. 
Users are able to see pictures about places in nearby areas. 
Users are able to see guidance-related details requested by the users so that they can explore tourist destinations better.
Users are able to Find Location, Locate in Map, Weather Forecast, and Calculate Distance between two Cities.
